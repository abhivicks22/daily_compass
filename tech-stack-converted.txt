DAILY COMPASS
Tech Stack & Enhancement Roadmap
Companion to PRD v1.0 • Optimized for Google Antigravity

February 2026

1. Core Tech Stack
This is the definitive technology stack for building Daily Compass in Google Antigravity. Each choice is optimized for: rapid agentic development, executive-dysfunction-friendly UX, offline capability, and progressive enhancement across all 4 phases.
1.1 Framework & Runtime
Layer
Technology
Why This Choice
Framework
React 18+
Functional components + hooks only. Antigravity has excellent React support via its Gemini agents. Component-based architecture maps perfectly to our modular phase structure.
Language
TypeScript
Type safety catches bugs early. Antigravity agents produce better TypeScript than JavaScript because types constrain generation. Critical for complex data models (DayEntry, HabitObject, GoalObject).
Build Tool
Vite 6+
Sub-second HMR (hot module reload). Instant dev server startup. Tree-shaking for minimal bundle. Antigravity can scaffold Vite projects natively.
Package Manager
pnpm
Faster installs, strict dependency resolution, disk-efficient. Better than npm for projects with many dependencies.
1.2 Styling & Design System
Layer
Technology
Why This Choice
CSS Framework
Tailwind CSS 4
Utility-first approach means Antigravity agents can style components inline without context-switching to separate CSS files. JIT compilation = zero unused CSS.
Component Library
shadcn/ui
Copy-paste components (not npm dependency). Full control over styling. Pre-built: buttons, dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, tooltips, calendars, sliders. Saves 60%+ of UI build time.
Icons
Lucide React
Clean, consistent icon set. Tree-shakeable (only imports used icons). Works perfectly with shadcn/ui.
Animations
Framer Motion
Declarative animations for React. Layout animations, gesture support, exit animations. Makes status transitions and streak celebrations feel alive.
Fonts
Google Fonts (Fraunces + Nunito Sans + JetBrains Mono)
Fraunces for headings (warm, serif). Nunito Sans for body (friendly, readable). JetBrains Mono for timer/data. Variable fonts for performance.
1.3 State Management & Storage
Layer
Technology
Why This Choice
State Management
Zustand
Minimal boilerplate (vs Context+useReducer). Built-in middleware for persistence. DevTools support. Perfect for medium-complexity apps. One store per domain (days, habits, goals, settings).
Persistent Storage
Dexie.js (IndexedDB)
Structured database in the browser. Handles 100K+ records without lag. Query by date ranges. Better than localStorage for complex data (arrays, nested objects). Supports transactions.
Storage Fallback
localStorage
Simple key-value pairs only: settings, theme preference, last-viewed date. Never for task/habit data.
Sync Layer (Enhancement)
Firebase / Supabase
Optional cloud sync for cross-device access. See Enhancements section. Not required for Phase 1–4.
1.4 Data, Charts & Utilities
Layer
Technology
Why This Choice
Charts
Recharts
React-native composable charts. Bar, Line, Pie, Radar, Area. Responsive. Customizable tooltips. Lighter than Chart.js. Used for weekly/monthly dashboards.
Date Handling
date-fns
Tree-shakeable (import only what you use). Immutable. Covers: week calculations, date ranges, formatting, relative time. No moment.js bloat.
Drag & Drop
@dnd-kit/core + @dnd-kit/sortable
Modern, accessible drag-and-drop for React. Phase 3: time-block rearrangement. Phase 4: priority matrix drag between quadrants. Touch + mouse support.
CSV Export
Papaparse
Robust CSV generation and parsing. Handles edge cases (commas in text, Unicode). One-click export of all historical data.
PDF Export
jsPDF + html2canvas
Generates PDF reports from rendered HTML. Charts render as images. Used for weekly/monthly report sharing.
Form Handling
React Hook Form + Zod
Minimal re-renders. Schema validation with Zod (same schemas for storage + forms). Fast task creation forms.
Routing
React Router v7
Client-side routing: /today, /week, /month, /journal, /habits, /settings. URL-based navigation for bookmarkability.
1.5 Development & Quality
Layer
Technology
Why This Choice
IDE
Google Antigravity
Agent-first IDE. Gemini 3 Pro agents can scaffold components, write tests, debug visually via browser sub-agents. Use Implementation Plans for each phase.
Linting
ESLint + Prettier
Consistent code formatting. Antigravity agents follow lint rules when generating code. Auto-fix on save.
Testing
Vitest + React Testing Library
Vitest is Vite-native (fast). RTL tests user behavior not implementation. Antigravity browser agents can also visually verify UI.
PWA
vite-plugin-pwa
Service worker for offline access. Installable on mobile/desktop. Auto-caching of app shell. Critical for reliability.

2. Project Setup Commands
Copy these into Antigravity’s terminal or give them as a prompt to the agent.

4. Antigravity-Specific Tips
Antigravity is an agent-first IDE — it works best when you give it structured, phase-based prompts rather than vague requests. Here’s how to maximize it for Daily Compass.
4.1 Prompting Strategy
	•	Always request an Implementation Plan first: Before any code, say "Generate an implementation plan artifact for Phase 1 features. List folder structure, component tree, data model, and dependencies. Ask for approval before coding."
	•	One feature per agent task: Don’t ask for "build the entire daily view." Instead: "Build the EnergyCheckin component that shows a 1–5 emoji scale, stores the selection in Zustand, and persists to Dexie."
	•	Use the browser sub-agent for testing: After building a component, tell the agent: "Launch the app in the browser, navigate to /today, test the energy checkin by clicking each level, and verify it persists on page refresh."
	•	Save reusable patterns to Knowledge Base: After the agent builds a good component pattern, tell it: "Save this component pattern (Dexie persistence + Zustand store + shadcn/ui) to the knowledge base for reuse."
	•	Use Artifacts for review: Ask the agent to generate screenshot artifacts of each component. Review them like a designer would review mockups. Leave inline comments to iterate.

5. Enhancement Roadmap (Post-Phase 4)
These are features beyond the core PRD that could significantly increase the app’s value. Organized by impact and complexity.
5.1 Tier 1: High Impact, Medium Effort
🔄 Cloud Sync (Cross-Device Access)
What
Sync all data across phone/laptop/tablet via cloud backend. Log on phone in the morning, review on laptop in the evening.
Tech
Supabase (PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions + auth + free tier). Alternative: Firebase Firestore.
Why Supabase
Open-source, PostgreSQL under the hood (real SQL queries for analytics), generous free tier (500MB DB, 50K active users), real-time sync, built-in auth (Google sign-in).
Effort
1–2 weeks. Replace Dexie reads/writes with Supabase client calls. Add conflict resolution (last-write-wins is fine for single-user).
Impact
★★★★★ — Removes the #1 risk of browser data loss. Enables mobile logging.

🤖 AI-Powered Weekly Insights (Gemini API)
What
Feed your weekly data to Gemini and get personalized analysis: pattern detection, specific suggestions, obstacle clustering, and motivational insights that understand YOUR data.
Tech
Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash) via Google AI Studio. Structured output mode for consistent JSON responses.
How It Works
Send weekly summary JSON (energy array, task completion rates, obstacles, mood data) to Gemini with a structured prompt. Get back: top 3 patterns noticed, 2 specific suggestions, 1 encouragement based on actual wins.
Example Output
"Your completion rate was 73% on high-energy days vs 18% on low-energy days. Consider front-loading your hardest tasks to mornings when your energy rating was 4+. You completed 5 job applications this week — that’s your best week in a month."
Effort
3–5 days. Single API call per weekly review. Cost: ~$0.01 per review (negligible).
Impact
★★★★★ — Transforms raw data into actionable intelligence. Like having a personal coach.

📱 Progressive Web App (Installable Mobile)
What
Install Daily Compass on your phone’s home screen like a native app. Works offline. Push notification reminders.
Tech
vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox. Service worker caches app shell + IndexedDB data.
Key Feature
Evening reminder notification: "Ready for your 2-minute check-in?" Morning notification: "Rate your energy to start the day." Both respect your boundaries — gentle nudges only.
Effort
3–5 days. Manifest file + service worker + notification permission flow.
Impact
★★★★ — Mobile access = actually use it daily. Notifications = external scaffolding for executive dysfunction.

5.2 Tier 2: High Impact, Higher Effort
🎮 Gamification & Rewards System
What
XP points for task completion. Levels that unlock themes/colors. Achievement badges ("7-day streak!", "First weekly review!", "50 tasks completed!"). Dopamine-friendly reward loops.
Why
Research shows gamification elements activate dopamine pathways that are underactive in ADHD. The variable reward schedule (random badges, level-up surprises) mirrors what makes social media addictive — but directed at productive behavior.
Effort
1–2 weeks. XP calculation engine + achievement definitions + unlock animations.
Impact
★★★★ — Turns the dopamine deficit into an advantage. Makes the app itself rewarding to use.

📊 Smart Obstacle Clustering (NLP)
What
Instead of keyword matching for obstacles, use embeddings to cluster similar obstacles: "got distracted by phone", "scrolled reels", "couldn’t stop watching shorts" all group as "Phone/Social Media Distraction".
Tech
Gemini Embedding API or local text-embedding via TF.js. Cluster with k-means or DBSCAN.
Effort
1 week. Embed obstacle strings, cluster, auto-label groups.
Impact
★★★ — Surfaces deeper patterns than simple keyword matching.

📅 Google Calendar Integration
What
Import Google Calendar events into the time-blocking view. See interviews, meetings, and commitments alongside planned work blocks. Export time-blocks back to Calendar.
Tech
Google Calendar API + OAuth 2.0. Read/write access to primary calendar.
Effort
1–2 weeks. OAuth flow + API integration + bidirectional sync logic.
Impact
★★★★ — Single source of truth for your day. No context-switching between calendar and compass.

5.3 Tier 3: Future Vision
Enhancement
Description
Effort
Impact
Voice Logging
"Hey Compass, I just finished 30 min of coding." Whisper API transcription + intent parsing. Log tasks by voice.
2–3 weeks
★★★★
Accountability Partner Mode
Share weekly reports with a trusted friend/spouse. They see your wins and progress. Optional: they can send encouragement within the app.
2 weeks
★★★★
Focusmate Integration
One-click link to schedule a Focusmate body-doubling session from any task. Pre-fill the task description.
2–3 days
★★★
Spaced Repetition for Skills
For Skill Learning tasks: auto-schedule review sessions using SM-2 algorithm. "You learned X 3 days ago — review today for retention."
1–2 weeks
★★★
Dark Mode
System-aware dark theme. All colors pre-defined in CSS variables for instant toggle. Warm dark palette (not pure black).
2–3 days
★★★
Therapist/Coach Export
Generate a formatted summary specifically designed for sharing with a mental health professional. Includes patterns, obstacles, mood data.
3–5 days
★★★★★
Interview Prep Module
Dedicated interview tracking: company, role, stage, prep tasks, outcome. Links to task system. Tracks application-to-interview conversion rate.
1 week
★★★★
Keyboard Shortcuts
Power-user shortcuts: N for new task, E for energy, W for wins, / for search. Reduces friction further.
2–3 days
★★★
